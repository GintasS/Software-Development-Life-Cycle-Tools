# Software-Development-Life-Cycle-Tools

In this repository, I will try gather various tools/techniques for covering the SDLC.
This is mostly technology independent, but I will try to focus on .NET/C#.

All of these descriptions are taken [devoxsoftware](https://devoxsoftware.com/blog/software-development-lifecycle/).

## 1. Analysis

Description:

> During this software development lifecycle phase, the specialists meticulously collect precise requirements from the customer to present a solution fine-tuned to their needs. 
> Any unclarities must be elucidated in this stage only.

**Tools/techniques/helpers:**

- Miro
- Diagrams
  - Context diagram
  - Functional decomposition
  - Use case diagram
  - Sequence diagram
  - AS-IS and TO-BE process model
  - User stories
  - Mind maps
  - Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)
  - Flowcharts
  - Gantt Charts
  - Gap Analysis

 ## 2. Planning
 
 Description:

> The purpose of the second stage is to outline the scope of the problem and identify solutions. Resources, costs, time, and other aspects should be considered here. The planning > phase of the SDLC is also when the project plan is developed that identifies, prioritizes, and assigns the tasks and resources required to build the structure for a project.
> With that said, this step culminates in a detailed project plan.

**Tools/techniques/helpers:**
- Miro
- Jira, Trello, GitHub
- Confluence

## 3. Architecture & Design

Description:

> The third phase entails two further steps – High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD). The result of the former is the future architecture of a software product,  
> whereas the LLD step describes how each and every feature in the product should work. It’s also in this phase when the database specification is developed to decide on data  
> management and storage for future processing, retrieval, or evaluation.
> Among other things, the development team will mull over the core components, structure, processing, and procedures for the system to reach the stated goal.

**Tools/techniques/helpers:**
- Miro
- High-Level Design charts
- Low-level Design charts
- Draw.io
- Confluence

## 4. Development

Description:
> Software development turns your project’s requirements and prototypes into a tangible solution. Thus, engineers start creating the entire system by crafting code using the required technology.

> During this software development lifecycle phase, clients will be able to have a first look at your future product. And by the end of the building process, clients will have an operating feature to share with the customers.
